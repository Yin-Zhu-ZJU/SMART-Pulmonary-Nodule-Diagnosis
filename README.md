This repository contains the code for the SMART platform â€” a multi-task diagnostic system for pulmonary nodule management. The platform leverages mass cytometry (CyTOF) and machine learning to:

DIA Module: Distinguish invasive from non-invasive pulmonary nodules.
SUR Module: Predict tumor invasiveness between minimally invasive (MIA) and invasive adenocarcinoma (IA).

SMART outperforms traditional clinical models and radiomics-based approaches, offering a non-invasive, high-resolution tool for early lung cancer detection and surgical decision-making
